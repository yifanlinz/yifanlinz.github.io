# Research

My research focuses on applying advanced statistical methods and machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems in healthcare and biomedical research.

## Onging Projects

### sensGAN: Adjusting for Unmeasured Confounders in Differential Expression Analyses with Application to Alzheimer's Disease
**Duration**: Oct 2024 - Present  
**Advisor**: Prof. Kevin Z. Lin, UW, Biostatistics  
**Description**: We propose *sensGAN*, a generative adversarial network guided by sensitivity analysis, to model unmeasured confounding in omics research of complex diseases. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis, for example, microglial cell states are biologically critical but often confounded by age and environmental exposures, making it difficult to isolate AD-specific effects. By constraining the predictive gains of latent confounder to be no greater than the strongest observed covariate, sensGAN facilitates the identification of resilient and consistent biomarkers in complex biological systems.

### Microglial Functional Heterogeneity Profiling with FastTopics
**Duration**: Oct 2024 - Present  
**Advisor**: Prof. Suman Jayadev, UW, Neurology  
**Description**: I proposed sensGAN, a generative adversarial network guided by sensitivity analysis, to model unmeasured confounding in omics research of complex diseases. In AD pathogenesis, for example, microglial cell states are biologically critical but often confounded by age and environmental exposures, making it difficult to isolate AD-specific effects. By constraining the predictive gains of latent confounder to be no greater than the strongest observed covariate, sensGAN facilitates the identification of resilient and consistent biomarkers in complex biological systems.   

  

## Previous Projects

### MIRAGE: Manifold-Informed Gene-module Extraction for Disentangling Simultaneous Dynamics in Single-Cell RNA-seq
**Duration**: March 2025 - Present  
**Advisor**: Prof. Kevin Z. Lin, UW, Biostatistics  
**Description**: We applied fastTopics, a probabilistic topic model, to characterize microglial functional heterogeneity on a continuous spectrum. This approach represents each cell as a mixture of functional modules, enabling the discovery of continuous microglial states. In both unsorted brain samples and microglia-specific datasets, the model recovered biologically coherent programs aligned with known cell types.

### Regulation of Zinc Fingers and Resulting Functional Directions in HuVECs Under Shear Stress 
**Duration**: July 2020 – October 2022  
**Advisor**: Prof. Shankar Subramaniam, UCSD, Bioengineering    
**Description**: I led bioinformatics analyses and lab experiments to understand the role of Zinc finger (ZNFs) transcription factors in the Endothelial-Mesenchymal Transition (EMT) using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HuVECs).
