# Research

My research focuses on applying advanced statistical methods and machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems in healthcare and biomedical research.

## Current Projects

### sensGAN: Adjusting for Unmeasured Confounders in Differential Expression Analyses with Application to Alzheimer's Disease
**Duration**: Oct 2024 - Present  
**Description**: Advised by Prof. Kevin Z. Lin, I proposed sensGAN, a generative adversarial network guided by sensitivity analysis, to model unmeasured confounding in omics research of complex diseases. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathogenesis, for example, microglial cell states are biologically critical but often confounded by age and environmental exposures, making it difficult to isolate AD-specific effects. By constraining the predictive gains of latent confounder to be no greater than the strongest observed covariate, sensGAN facilitates the identification of resilient and consistent biomarkers in complex biological systems.
