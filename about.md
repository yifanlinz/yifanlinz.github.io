# About Me

I am a Master student on the thesis track at UW Biostatistics.  Previously, I received my B.S. from the department of Bioengineering at UCSD. 

## Background

My past experiences working with diverse biomedical datasets have revealed a growing disconnect between the rapid expansion of biomedical data and our ability to interpret it effectively. This realization has fueled my interest in bridging this gap through the development of specialized statistical methods tailored to biomedical big data. For my Master’s thesis, I developed a framework that integrates generative modeling, causal reasoning, and statistical rigor to explore latent confounding in complex biological systems. This work inspires my broader interests of leveraging AI-driven methods to describe, understand, and predict complex biological systems. These experiences have deepened my commitment to advancing data-driven biomedical research and strongly motivated my pursuit of PhD training.

## Research Philosophy

I believe that the best research comes from asking the right questions and being willing to explore uncharted territories. My approach combines theoretical rigor with practical applications, always keeping in mind how research can benefit society.

## Personal Interests

I enjoy cooking, eating, and dancing in my free time.
