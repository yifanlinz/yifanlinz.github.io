# About Me

I am a Master student on the thesis track at UW Biostatistics.  Previously, I received my B.S. from the department of Bioengineering at UCSD. 

## Background

Through my work with biomedical big data in academia and industry, I have seen how modern assays reveal facets of biological systems previously inaccessible while introducing new analytical challenges. As an undergraduate researcher at UCSD, I worked with time-series omics datasets that captured rich transcriptional dynamics but required rigorous statistical correction and biological validation to disentangle signals from technical noises. Later in industry, I encountered a parallel issue: high-dimensional genomic variant data enabled strong predictive models but far outpaced the availability of reliable clinical labels, limiting biological interpretability. Across both settings, I observed a central challenge of modern biomedicine–our ability to measure biology is advancing faster than our ability to interpret it.

Motivated by this gap, I pursued the Biostatistics Master’s program at UW to build a rigorous mathematical and statistical foundation for principled model development. Through my Master’s training, I learned to approach biomedical modeling through the lens of statistical inference and machine learning (ML) theory rather than black-box prediction alone. This shift reshaped how I design models and ultimately led me to develop *sensGAN*, a framework that integrates statistical sensitivity analysis with generative modeling to detect latent confounding in high-dimensional omics data. Building on this work, I now seek PhD training to deepen the theoretical and methodological basis of interpretable ML and to scale these ideas in a PhD thesis.
